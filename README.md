To install :

To use :

Click on the icon on the upper right of Chrome, next to the burger menu.

What could be better :

- Using Typescript (Haxe do not seem like a viable option)
- A probability metric could be added
- Use other source of data (like aria-labels and content which could be problematics because of translations)
- Better UI
- UT/IT
